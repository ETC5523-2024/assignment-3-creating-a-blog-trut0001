    "text": "The International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) current approach to measuring a country’s Olympic performance is tallying gold medals. While silver and bronze medals are recorded, they do not affect the final tally unless two countries are tied with gold medals.\nIt can be argued that there are two problems with the IOC’s current approach to measuring Olympic performance:\n\nIt is disrespectful to athletes who win silver and bronze medals. In most cases, athletes who won silver and bronze medals do not have their medals counted towards their country’s tally. An athlete might win a silver or bronze medal, but their achievement does not represent their country unless there is a tie for gold medals. One of the three values of the Olympics is Respect (Committee 2024). And, it can be argued that the IOC is insufficiently respecting their athletes by not factoring in who win silver and bronze medals.\nTallying only gold medals is not a comprehensive look at athletic excellence. A country may win numerous silver and bronze medals, but if they win no gold medals then they would be ranked as one of the weakest countries in the Olympic games. Of the 184 countries who competed in the 2024 Olympic Games, 144 did not earn a gold medal. In other words, 78% of all countries who competed in the Olympics were not seriously considered in the final results. Along with Respect, another value of the Olympic games is Excellence. It can be argued that the IOC is not sufficiency measuring excellence by ignoring silver and bronze medal wins. Some countries, like the United States, report all medals earned in their news and media (Nicholas and Ryan 2024). But, this is not how the IOC tallies results.\n\nSome have proposed other ways to rank country performance at the Olympics. Researchers Robert C Duncan and Andrew Parece published their own ranking method in the Journal of Sports Analytics that accounts for a country’s probability of winning a medal if populations were the same across countries (Nicholas and Ryan 2024). This approach was dubbed the “Duncan-Parece model”. Although this calculation is useful in considering population size, the primary limitation is that it may be difficult for the public to both understand and trust a calculation that is based on probability calculations.\nSo, here’s the question - is there a better way to to measure Olympic medal performance that is inclusive of all medals while still prioritising gold medals? To answer this question, let’s pull some data and do some analysis."

This webpage includes a large table showing every country who earned at least one medal in the 2024 Olympics held in Paris, which is a total of 91 countries. The table provides information on the number of gold, silver, and bronze wins for each country. Because the data was captured directly from the Olympics website, there was no concern about data quality. According to the webpage, the data was last updated on 12 August, 2024. The data has no missing values. The data variables included Order, NOC (Country), Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Total. It does not include medals won by AIN, which are “individual neutral athletes” who competed without representing a country.\nThere are 9 variables in the dataset. The variable Country is the name of the country that competed in the 2024 Olympic games. Weighted Total Score is the total number of points a country has earned where a gold earns 3 points, a silver earns 2 points, and a bronze earns 1 point. This measure will be explored more in the next section. The next 3 variables are Gold, Silver, and Bronze, which show the total number of medals a country won for each respective category. Lastly, Total Medals shows the total number of gold, silver, and bronze medals that a country won.\nThere were no data cleaning steps needed, as the data was pulled directly from the Olympics website. No API or data scraping tool was used. I just manually inputted the data from the 92 records of countries, which took about 5 minutes to do.

    "text": "Analysis\nThe original question was, “is there a better way to to measure Olympic medal performance that is inclusive of all medals while still prioritising gold medals?” I’d like to introduce a new measure called Weighted Total Score (colloquially dubbed “Olympic Points”), which would provide a final score for each country where a gold medal earns 3 points, a silver medal earns 2 points, and a bronze medals earns 1 point. For example, if Australia won 10 gold, 5 silver, and 1 bronze, then the country’s Weighted Total Score would equal 41 (30 gold + 10 silver + 1 bronze). There are two benefits of this new measure. First, unlike IOC’s current approach, it is inclusive of all medals while prioritising the achievement of gold over silver over bronze. Second, it is easier for the public to understand compared to other suggested new measures like the Duncan-Parece model.\nThe main limitation of this new calculation is that it requires the public to shift their previous understanding of measuring Olympic performance from a medal count to a medal score. The public may be confused at first as to what the Weighted Total Score means, and they might assume that the score is a count. To mitigate this risk, we can do three things:\n\nAdd the Weighted Total Score to existing visualisations of medal counts. In doing this, the public will have a better opportunity to learn what the calculation is while referring to something familiar. They will see an addition of a new measure and not a replacement.\nVisually signify that the Weighted Total Score is different from the existing measures. This delineation could be done through bolding, highlighting, colour choice, or a line separator. The purpose of this is to draw attention to the new measure and indicate that it is different from medal counts.\nAdd concise language that defines the new measure and explains why it was introduced. This language should be placed above the visualisation so that the audience can have context before viewing the visualisation.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, The Olympics website visualises medal counts using a table, sorting countries based off of who won the most gold medals (“Medal Table” 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: 2024 Olympic Medal Table from olympics.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a similar table with the addition of the recommended Weighted Total Score:\n\n\n\n2024 Olympic Medal Table\nWeighted Total Score calculated as 3 points for Gold, 2 for Silver, and 1 for Bronze\n\n\nCountry\nWeighted Total Score\nGold\nSilver\nBronze\nTotal Medals\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n250\n40\n44\n42\n126\n\n\nChina\n198\n40\n27\n24\n91\n\n\nFrance\n122\n16\n26\n22\n64\n\n\nAustralia\n108\n18\n19\n16\n53\n\n\nJapan\n97\n20\n12\n13\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Weighted Total Score is the first measure provided for each country and it is bolded to differientiate itself from the other mesaures. The other measures of Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Total Medal Count are still visualised for reference to the viewers. The benefit of the new measure of Weighted Total Score is that it is inclusive of all medals while still prioritising gold medals, thereby addressing the problem and question stated at the beginning of this blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: 2024 Olympic Weighted Total Score Bar Chart\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 is a bar chart that visualises the Weighted Total Score for each country in the 2024 Olympics. This would be used when the focus is specifically on the Weighted Total Score and not on medal count. This would best be used once the audience is familiar enough with the score to view it, understand it, and trust it. Otherwise, the table above is the safer option."

    "title": "Assignment 1 - ETC 5523",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Article A - The Green Divide: How Wealth Buys Shade in a Warming World\nThe article studied here is titled “The Green Divide: How Wealth Buys Shade in a Warming World” by Kate Newton, and it is available online from Stuff.co.nz. Stuff is a New Zealand news media website, whose parent company is a media conglomerate named Stuff Ltd. This is considered “print media” because Stuff sources their articles from Stuff Ltd newspapers, such as The Post and The Press. \nThe article summarises how tree shade is an important counter to global warming. The article provides visualisations showing how high-income neighbourhoods have more access to tree shade while low-income neighbourhoods have less access to tree shade.\nThe first six paragraphs are background information as to why tree shade is better at lowering temperatures than other shade. It does this through three methods. First, the author invites the reader to imagine a hot day and asks if they would prefer sitting under the shade of a building or a tree. Second, the author provides a quote from a professor on urban forestry, where he states his preference for the shade of a tree. Third, the author provides a graphic showing how trees provide better cooling than buildings because of their shade and evaporation of rainwater. This context is useful because it explains why tree shade is important and why it is a problem that tree shade is less available for poor communities.\nThe lede is located in the first sentence of the article and just below the graphic title, which is normal for printed media. It is bolded to catch the reader’s attention. This lede provides further meaning to the title, stating:\n“The cooling shade of trees will be crucial to adapting to climate change. But data from New Zealand cities shows tree cover is uneven — and often dictated by wealth.”\nThe summary is found after the background information. It states:\n“At a more fundamental level, wealth often corresponds to whether you live in a cool neighbourhood or a hot one. Shade and prosperity are linked together in the phrase ‘leafy suburbs,’ used as a byword for New Zealand’s well-heeled, established neighbourhoods.”\nThe article then provides more details, maps, and other visualisations to support the statement that shade is more available in rich communities. It is assumed that the reader either be from New Zealand, live in New Zealand, or have knowledge of the different cities and neighbourhoods of New Zealand. \nThe main result of the story is a call to action for local governments to be mindful of tree shade as they develop communities. The purpose of the article is to equip the public and decision-makers with information so that they can affect change for all communities, not just those that are affluent. The main result is located in is the last paragraph of the article:\n“What tree canopy mapping can do, though, is show where trees are and aren’t — and how that is changing. “If [councils] know that there are neighbourhoods that only have four per cent canopy cover, they would hopefully see it as their responsibility to increase canopy cover in that area.”\nArticle B - Wordle, 15 Million Tweets Later\nThe article studied here is “Wordle, 15 Million Tweets Later”, available online at observablehq.com. Observable is a company that provides data visualisation solutions for web apps. A portion of their website is a blog to showcase data visualisation work. This article was published by a public contributor named Robert Lesser.\nThe blog post analyses the behaviour of people who play Wordle and share their results on Twitter. Key findings were that there is some level of player success predictability based on the structure of the Wordle (ex: having double letters), and that players are less likely to share their results on Twitter if the word is more difficult. This is likely due to players performing poorly and not wanting to share their results. \nThe first two paragraphs provide background information on Wordle’s popularity. The article states that a reason Wordle became so popular is because players started sharing their Wordle results on Twitter. This background information is relevant because it provides context before the author shares his analysis.\nThe lede in this article is found in the title itself - “Wordle, 15 Million Tweets Later”. Although it is unusual to put the lede in the title, this is useful in an informal blog post because it grabs the reader’s attention. This title provides both context and scale to the reader. “15 Million” is a large number and shows the scale of this analysis, and the reader immediately understands that the context of the article is about Wordle. Because this analysis is exploratory, there is not a call to action or recommendation in the article or the lede. Instead, this lede describes the purpose behind the article - exploring a large number of tweets about Wordle. \nThe summary of the article can be found just after introduction, and it is a simple sentence:\n“So, to really understand Wordle, I had to look at the tweets – all 15 million of them”.\nThis summary is similar to the lede in that it concisely states the purpose of this blog post - to share his analysis of 15 million tweets. The author is simply sharing some analyses that he found interesting.  \nThe main result are the various visualisations and findings that the reader can explore. The author provides a final section named “Further Exploration”, which includes a link to an appendix with more visualisations. Another notable feature of this blog post is that the reader can click on each visualisation to view the raw code used to make the visualisations. The entire blog post is intended to be inspected, explored, and used by the reader for further analysis, if desired. \n\n\nArticle C - How did Australia’s housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing’s fault?\nThe article studied here is titled “How did Australia’s housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing’s fault?”by Guardian Australia, and it is available on The Guardian’s Youtube Channel. Guardian Australia is the Australian website of the British online and print newspaper, The Guardian. This article is a five minute video that utilises journalistic storytelling and data visualisations. This video format is used to concisely and casually communicate to a large audience. \nThe video summarises two key contributors to the high prices of the Australia housing market - negative gearing and the capital gains tax. The video explores what these two terms are, their history in Australia policymaking, and how they contribute to making the Australian housing market so expensive. \nThe video opens with background information about the Australian housing market. The host shows a time series plot that compares house prices versus household disposable income from 1989 to 2022. Since 2000, the gap between disposable income and house prices has widened considerably.This means that as each year has passed, houses are less affordable for the average consumer. This context is helpful to the viewer so they know what problem is being discussed and why. \nThe lede of the video is in the title - “How did Australia’s housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing’s fault?” Putting the lede in the title is standard practice for YouTube videos - even from reputable news sources - as the thumbnail and video title are used to drive interest and summarise the video topic to the prospective viewer.  \nThe video summarises their main point from 4:05 to 4:30. The main point is that both negative gearing and low capital gains tax rates have contributed to increased housing prices because they incentivise investors to continue investing in the housing market. The video states:\n“Investors are now so heavily protected by the tax system that they are willing to take even bigger risks and spend even more money on the properties they are buying, which of course makes housing prices rise faster, which then makes the combination of negative gearing and capitals gains discounts even more profitable, which means investors are willing to spend even more, which makes house prices rise even faster, and would you look at that - it’s like we’re are almost in a vicious cycle.” \nOther factors may contribute to higher prices in the housing market, but those are not discussed in the video. This is understandable for two reasons. First, this video is both concise and casual, so it is limiting the scope to two key topics. Second, it is focusing on answering the question “is it all negative gearing’s fault?” This is done by explaining what negative gearing is and then exploring the capital gains tax. The video does not assume that the viewer has previous knowledge about negative gearing or the capital gains tax.\nThe main result of this video is the audience’s better understanding of how Australia’s housing market got so expensive, and how negative gearing and capital gains tax incentives have significantly contributed to rising house prices. There is no explicit call to action for community building, advocacy, or policy change. Instead, Guardian Australia is providing information to their audience about a particular social issue and letting the audience decide what to do with that information. \nComparing And Contrasting the Articles\nThere are three similarities among the articles:\n\nUse of data visualisations. All of the articles use data visualisations to communicate their point. Well-designed data visualisations are helpful for audiences to understand, trust, and retain information. The Stuff article primarily uses heat maps while the Wordle blog post and Guardian video use time series plots. \nUse of an attention-grabbing hook statement. All of the articles try to catch the reader’s attention with either their title or lede. This is to be expected, as these articles are online and require the reader to click through and engage. The authors want the audience to make the decision to engage with the material based on a hook that is appealing to them. \nUse of colloquial language. All of the articles used a communication style that is non-academic and appeals to a large public audience. For example, the Stuff article has hand-drawn illustrations, the blog post is formatted as an approachable blog, and the video has an in-person host using gen-z vernacular like “cooked”. \n\nThere are also formatting differences among the articles. Both the Stuff article and Wordle blog post use the inverted pyramid format, while the Guardian Australia video uses an hourglass format. The inverted pyramid format is effective in catching the reader’s attention with a main point, supporting that main point with more details, then ending with supplemental data. The Stuff article starts with the lede in the opening sentence, while Stuff provides the lede in the title. They then follow up with more details and supplemental data. The hourglass format provides the crucial details in the beginning, gives the narrative, and then ends by summarising the main point. The hourglass format is effective in ensuring that the audience comprehends and retains the full picture of what is being communicated. The Guardian video starts with the crucial information about the housing crisis, provides the narrative around negative gearing and capital gains tax, and then ends with the summarising point of how housing prices continue to rise. \nAnother difference is in the intent of the articles. The intent of the Stuff article is to educate the audience and provide a call to action in regards to global warming. Stuff suggests that local governments should be more mindful of tree shade when planning communities. On the other hand, the Wordle blog post and the Guardian video intend to be educational and do not have an explicit call to action to their audience."
