Hi there! My name is Travis Rutledge, and I am a data analytics professional with 10 years of experience in transforming complex data into actionable insights. Proficient in data transformation, visualisation, dashboard development, Tableau, SQL, R, and Alteryx, I enjoy creating innovative tools that enhance operational efficiency. I've previously worked for Amazon, Goodwill Industries International, and International Justice Mission. I'm currently a graduate student in the Master in Business Analytics course at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.
